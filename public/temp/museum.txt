NXX I think it's time for some ancient history. I decide to go to the museum.
NNX Although neither me nor Laura are interested in ancient history, I decide that it's fun to learn about new things. 
NNX Maybe we'll discover that we like it.
NNG We're going to the museum? Interesting.

NNX There are so many things to look at. I don't know where to start
NNG Let's look at the natural wonders section first. 
NNG I don't know if you know this, but I'm a huge fan of biology. 
NNP Ok, sure, let's check it out. 
NNX I look at prehistoric animals, such as trilobite fossils.
NNX They were sea creatures that went extinct in the Permian extinction event.
NNX Then, we went to the section on ancient civilizations.
NNX I learned so much about them. 
NNX The Iliad and Odyssey of Homer, the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, The dynasties of China.
NHG What's do you find most interesting?
NHP That we still don't know who King Tutankhamun's mother is.
NNP Her mummy has been found, she's the "Younger Lady" in KV35.
NNP But we still don't know her name or identity. 
NNG That intrigues me too. Also the way she died. 
NNG It was from a blow to her face. 
NNX We continue looking at various artifacts in the museum , then after we're done, we go back.

NNP Ok, sure, let's check it out. 
NNX I look at prehistoric animals, such as trilobite fossils.
NNX But I don't find it very interesting.
NNX They lived millions of years ago and not in the same time period as us.
NNX Then, we go to the ancient civilizations section. 
NNP To be honest, I don't think this stuff is that important. 
NNP It's from such a long time ago and I don't think it's that relevant to today.  
NNG I don't think so, history gives us the context of why the things are the way they are today.
NNP But why do I need to know the "why"? Can't I just live life without questioning why things are the way they are?
NNP I can drive a car without thinking about who invented cars and their history.
NNG You're right that you don't need to know history to drive a car. 
NNG But do you ever get curious? 
NNP I just don't think it's important.
NNX We quickly go through the entire museum, visiting each area only briefly, then go back.
