NXX I want to do something fun with Laura. Something that gets both of us moving.
NXX I decide to go skating with her.
XNG Skating sounds fun, let's try it.

NXX We go to the skating rink, and try to put on our shoes.
XNG I need help putting these on.
NNP You have to loosen the laces first. Then, tighten them after you put your feet in.
NXX We put on our helmets and get on the ice.
XNG I'm a little nervous about falling. It's scary.
NNP It'll be fine, just get back up.
NNX We skate around for a little bit, it wasn't long before Laura fell down.
XSG It's hard to get up, the ice is so slippery.
NNP Get on your knees, then put one knee up, then the other. 
XNG Thanks.
NNX We were nervous at first, but after doing a few laps, we gained confidence and skill.
NNX After a few minutes, we skated around the entire rink without falling. 
XHG This is fun! I'm starting to get the hang of it now.
XHG I like this a lot. I'll try skating backwards now. 
HHX After skating around a few more times, forwards and backwards, we decide it's time to go back.

XSG I can't even get back up, the ice is so slippery.
NSP I actually don't know how to get back up. I've never skated before.
XSG I don't want to be stuck here. 
NNX She slides back to the entrance and gets up there. 
NNX I think that having an instructor would be better.
NNX An insutructor would teach us techniques on how to skate properly, but we don't have one right now. 
NNX I can tell Laura isn't very happy either.
XSG I don't want to do this anymore, can we leave?
NNP Ok, let's go.
