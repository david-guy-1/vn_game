NNP Try drawing a grassy scene. Green on the bottom and blue on the top.

XNG What are you drawing?
NNP A city landscape with buildings.
NNP I grew up in a place like this.
NNP I lived in an apartment. When I looked outside I saw tall buildings and windows.

NNX I had a lot of fun making the paintings.
NNX We made mistakes but we didn't care as it's not serious.

XSG Can we do something else? 
NNX I don't want to force Laura into doing something she doesn't want to do, so we leave.
