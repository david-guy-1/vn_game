NXX And that's the end of my morning lecture.
NXX I have no classes this afternoon. I have the rest of the day free!
NXX What should I do? 
NXX I'll ask my classmate, Laura, if she wants to do anything with me.
NNP Hey Laura, I'm free for the rest of the day today.
NNP Do you want to go do something with me?
XNG Sure! I have the rest of the day free too. 
XNG Just make sure to drop me home by tonight.
HHP Yay! 
HHX And so, Laura and I get into my car and start driving around, looking for places to do.
