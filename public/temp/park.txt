NXX Laura wanted to relax a little bit, so we decided to take a walk in the park.
NXX I didn't know she is a nature-loving girl, but the park can be an interesting place to be in.
NXX I find a nearby park and drive there. 
NXP We're here now, let's go!
XHG Yay!

XHG I love taking walks in the park. 
XHG Listening to the breeze, the birds singing
XHG The kids playing, the people walking.
XHG It's so relaxing and peaceful.
HHP Me too.  
HHP This place reminds me of my childhood
HHP I used to play tag with my friends and neighbors here all the time. 
HHP When I was a child, after I got home from school I couldn't wait to play with my friends. 
HHP I had so much fun!
HHP Let's play right now!
HHP Tag! You're it!
HXX I touch Laura and then run away as fast as I can
HXX It's only a matter of time before she catches me
XHG You're it!
HXX We had a lot of fun playing with each other, talking about our childhoods, and about interesting things that we saw in the park.
HXX I can tell that both Laura and I had a good time here.

NNX We get out of the car and start walking around in the park
XNG I used to love playing in the park when I was a child.
XSG But now that I'm an adult...
XSG I don't have anyone to play with. All of my childhood friends have mvoed away.
HSP Why not play with me?
HNG I guess I could, but I've kinda grown out of playground games now. 
HNG I prefer doing other stuff now.
NXX We take a short walk then go back to the car.
