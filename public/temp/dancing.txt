NXP I'm not sure what to do next.
NXP I want something we can do together, and something that we can do instead of just look at.
NNG Let's try dancing together.  
NNP I'm not very good at dancing.
NNG Neither am I, but we can at least try something slow and easy.

NNX We go to the dance hall and start dancing. 
NNG Which one should we do first?
NNP How about we do a slow, easy one together. Nothing too intense.
NNP Like I said, I'm not very good at dancing. 
NNG Ok, let's do a slow waltz.  
NNX I watch my feet very carefully to make sure that I don't step on hers.
NNG Slow ballroom dances are my favorite. 
NNG I don't like those physically exhausting dances.  
NNG I just want to have fun and relax.
NNP Yeah, me too.
NNP I'm new to this kind of thing. I've never danced with anyone actually. 
NNG It's not that hard if you get into the rhythm and develop muscle memory.
NNG You need to know where to move your feet, but it's not that hard.
NNX Dancing with Laura and seeing her face up close...
HNX Made me realize just how gorgeous she is. 
HNX We both loved dancing together. 
NNX After we finish dancing, we go back.

NNX But it's hard, I keep on stumbling
SNP Oh, sorry!
SNP I didn't mean to step on your toes.
SNG It's ok, everyone makes mistakes when they first start.
SNG I don't know what I'm doing either. 
SNX But as much as I try not to, I keep on making mistakes and fumbling.
SNX She does so too. I know she doesn't really care about mistakes, but I do care.
SNX I don't enjoy this at all.
NNX After we finish dancing, we go back.
