NNP I have an idea, since we're both majoring in STEM fields, let's do something that requires our brains?
NNG Like what?
NNP How about solving puzzles. An escape room!

NNX We visit a nearby escape room and get ready.
NNX After the host explains the rules, we go inside and try to solve the puzzles.
XNG This PIN pad needs a 8-digit code. 
NNP I found this piece of paper inside this cupboard. It's a green light of some kind from a chess pawn. 
NNG Hmm... maybe there is something in this room that acts as a light. 
NHG I found it! There's a switch on this blue/green thing in the corner. It's the light we're looking for!
NNP The shadows of the pillars look like they're pointing at something.
HHP Oh, it's a loose tile in the wall! Let's see what's inside here!
NNG It's piece of paper with colors and numbers. 
NNG Maybe it has something to do with the multicolored grid on the door?
NNG Also, what's inside this purplish thing? 
NNG A bunch of math equations. 3 + 7 = 1, 7 + 8 = 6, 5 + 8 = 4
NNP What could this mean? So we add them we get have 10 = 1, 15=6, 13=4
NNP I got it! It's arithmetic mod 9!
NNP Here's an idea. Convert the colors on the grid into numbers, then add them mod 9.
NNP Input that into the PIN pad. 
NNX We try that and the door opens!
HHP We did it!
HHG We're such geniuses.

NNX But then we get stuck. We ask for a hint.
NNX A voice comes from the speaker : "The walls are not as they seem! Look at where the shadows point." 
NNX We keep looking at the walls and eventually find something. 
HHP Oh, it's a loose tile in the wall! Let's see what's inside here!
NNG It's piece of paper with colors and numbers. 
NNP This could match up with the multicolored grid on the door.
NNX But no matter what we try, nothing seems to work. 
NNX We ask for another hint.
NNX A voice comes again: "Add them row by row".
NNG So, we just convert colors into numbers, and then add the rows?
NNG We get numbers above 10, and can't use them for the PIN pad.
NNX We try various things, entering only the first digits, only the last ones, and various other things.
NNX In the end, none of them work and the time runs out. 
NNX The voice comes up again : "Add them and reduce mod 9". 
SSX Why didn't we think of that! 
SSX We feel dumb as we leave the escape room.
