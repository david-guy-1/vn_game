NXX I want to play a game. I don't want to just walk around and look at stuff.
NNP Do you have any ideas on any games we can play?
NNG Let's go bowling. There's a bowling alley nearby. 
NNP Sure thing. Let's go there.

NNX When we get there, we put on our bowling shoes and get ready. 
NNP These balls are so much heavier than I expected. 
NNP Now, how do we do this?
NNInstructor Aim at the "sweet spot" between the 1 and 3 pins.
NNInstructor Keep your arm straight. 
NNX I throw my first ball and it goes in the gutter.
SNP Oh no!
NNG Let me try!
NNG At least I hit the pins, but it's a 7-10 split. 
NNInstructor Those are almost impossible to convert. 
NNInstructor It's technically possible, but you need to make the pin hit the wall and then bounce back to the other pin. 
NNInstructor You should just try to get one of the pins.
NNX She throws another ball but misses.
NNX The instructor teaches us the right techniques to throw the ball, and then me and Laura play a round against each other.
NNX Neither of us are very good. We never got any strikes or spares.
NNX In the end, she won by a few points.
NHG Yay! I won! This is so much fun!
HHP I had fun too even though I didn't win. 
NHX After we're done playing, we leave.

NNX But as much as I try, I can never get it right.
NNG Let me try! 
NSG Oh no, mine went in the gutter too!
NNX Neither me nor Laura are any good at bowling, we can't get anything right.
NNX And we're not having fun either, failing over and over again.
NNX After we realize that neither of us actually wants to do this, we decide to leave.
