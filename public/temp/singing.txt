XNG Hey I have an idea!
XNG Let's go to a karaoke bar! I want to hear you sing!
NNP I'm not very good of a singer though. Are you sure?
XNG Even if it's bad it won't be that big of a deal.
NNP I'm actually horrible at singing. You don't want to hear it. 
XNG Come on, you keep telling me to try new things. Why not take your own advice and try new things?
NNP Ok, let's go then.

NNX We got to the karaoke bar, start a song, and try to sing along.
NNP Let's choose an easy one to start with.
NNP Au clair de la lune, mon ami Pierrot...
NNX I realize that my singing is completely out of tune.
NNX But Laura wanted me to take my own advice, so I kept singing.
NNX When I'm done, I asked her what she thought of it.
NHG For someone who says they're horrible at singing, it's actually not that bad.
NHG Now let me try.
NNX Of course, she's much better than I am. 
NNX I really love how good she is at singing. 
NHG You try again!
NHP Ok... 
NHX This time I feel a little bit more confident. 
NHX She told me "it's actually not that bad" and I believe her.
NHX We sing a few songs together, and then we go back.

NNX So, I stop. 
XNG Is something wrong?
SNP I'm singing horribly, completely out of tune, and my voice crackles.
XNG It's not that bad. Don't worry about it.
XNG We're here to have fun.
SNP I'm not having fun!
XNG Let me try then. You just listen.
SNX Of course, she's much better than I am. 
SNX I'm jealous at how good she is at singing. 
SNX I'll never be as good as her.
SNX After singing a few songs together, we go back, not very happy.
