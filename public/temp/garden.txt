NXX I have an idea for something interesting and unique. 
NXP Let's visit a botanical garden!
NXP We can look at flowers and other types of plants there.
XHG I would love to!
XHG I'm fascinated about plants and nature in general.

NXX We arrive at the garden, we walk around and look at the various plants there.
XHG Did you know that plant cells are different from animal cells?
XHG They have a cell wall. 
NHP What's that?
XHG It provides structural support for the cell, and is semi-permeable. 
XHG That means some things can pass through but not others. 
XHG Also, have you heard of the Calvin cycle?
NHP I think so, it's a chemical reaction, right?
XHG Yes, it takes carbon dioxide and other substances, and makes glucose
XHG Some of it is light-dependent, it's a part of photosynthesis.
NHP This is all very fascinating. Where can I learn more about it?
XHG I learned it from reading textbooks.
XHG My father is a biologist (although not a botanist) and he had a ton of books on various subjects.
XHG Cellular biology, ecology, biochemistry, and evolutionary biology.
XHG When I was young I loved reading them.
HHX I chatted with Laura about plants, she taught me so much and I loved learning about those things.
HHX Eventually, we saw everything and it's time to go back.

NHP Is botany interesting to you?
XHG Yes! I'm fascinated about plants and nature in general.
NHP It's boring though. Plants don't even move or walk around. They just stay there.
XSG How can you say that? Plants grow food for humans and animals. They're an essential part of the ecosystem.
NSP I don't really care about them, that's all. I know they're important but to me, all they do is look pretty.
NSX Laura keeps on trying to tell me fun facts to get me to like plants, but I'm just not interested in it.
SSX I just want to look at pretty flowers, I find her attempts distracting.
SSX I don't think Laura liked it either, I don't share the same enthusiasm as her.
SSX After we see everything, we go back, neither of us very happy.
