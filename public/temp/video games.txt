NXX I want to go back to the university campus and do something there.
NXX It was then when I remembered that I just bought a new video game last night.
NNP Come to my dorm room. Let's play a game together.

NNX We head to my room where I show her the new video game that I just bought.
NNP It's an RPG dungeon crawler with strategy elements. Let's try it together! 
XHG Sure thing, how do I play?
HHP I don't know either, I just bought it. I haven't played it yet.
XHG Let's learn it together, then.
NNX We play the game together, it was a lot of fun. I couldn't figure out some parts of it and Laura helped me with it. 
XHG Watch out! There's a monster there!
XHG I think you can avoid the attacks if you dodge them, but not if you try to block them with your shield.
XHG Learn flaming blast as soon as possible. It does tons of damage.
XHG I just cleared the 10th level by spamming that spell the entire time.
HHP Thanks for the advice. I've made so much progress because of you. 
HHX After we've gotten through a significant part of the game, I felt burnt out and decided to do something else.

XNG You're probably better than me at it.
HHP No, I just bought this game yesterday. I didn't play it yet. 
HHP I don't know anything about how this game works. 
XHG Let's learn it together, then.
NNX But as we played, I realized there is a huge issue.
SNX It's too complicated. There are so many instructions and the tutorial isn't that good.
SSG I'm not having fun. I don't really understand this game at all.
SSG And the graphics aren't that good.
SSG Can we do something else?
