NXX I drive to the place and walk there
HNP Now look over there
XHG It's gorgeous!
XHG I love the view here! 
HHP It's amazing, isn't it?
HHP My mother took me to this place when I was young.
HHP I used to be obsessed with this place.
HHP I constantly begged my mother to go here all the time.
HHP My favorite part is that I can see the entire city from here.
HHP I felt like an angel, watching down from heaven.
XHG That mountain is gorgeous!
XHG I want to climb to the top of that mountain.
NHP It's a bit too far away though. We can't go there today.
NHP Maybe sometime later, we can go climb that mountain together. 
HHX I spend some time enjoying the beautiful scenery with Laura.
HHX I wish I can just stay here forever.
SXX But alas I can't. Eventually we decide to go back
HHX I can tell that Laura enjoyed the view just as much as I did. 
NXX We go back to the car and drive to our next destination.

XHG I know a place with a very nice view 
XHG Do you want to go there?
NXX Going to a place merely for the view isn't really my thing, but I decide to go there anyways, just for Laura.
HHP Ok, tell me where it is.
NXX I drive to the place and get off the car.

NHP Here it is. Do you like the view?
NHX The view is nice, I'll admit, but it's a bit boring.
NHX I don't know why I had to drive here to see it when I can just look at it from my smartphone's screen. 
SHP It's ok, I guess.
SSG What do you mean "it's ok"? You don't like it.
NSP I mean, I like it, ... but ... 
NSP It's not that much different from the scenery that I can look at on my phone.
XSG Looking at something on the phone is nothing like looking at it in real life!
NSX I realize that Laura isn't happy, so I decide to just drop the subject and go back.
